                <h3>About Me, the Developer</h3>
                <p>I built My Desk out of a personal need for a straightforward, beautiful space to manage my own day-to-day tasks and thoughts. I found that most apps were cluttered and overly complex. My goal was to build a tool that feels like a clean notebook—a digital space where you can focus on what matters most, without any distractions.</p>
